TPP Job Launcher: Thorny Flat Edition


Author:    Sarah Burke-Spolaor
Init Date: 22 May 2023

This code will be called by the Globus file transfer script (intended
to be written by Joe Glaser). The purpose of this code is to:

 - Be runnable on Thorny Flat (and potentially easily repurposed for
   Dolly Sods in the future).

 - Access the TPP database manager (TPP-DB).

 - Identify the location of requested data from TPP-DB.

 - Set up the job command and call Slurm.

 - Also initiate a Globus transfer of H5 files to JBOD at the end of
   the script? Or will this be done in the processing script? - Joe G
   to comment.
